Version 1.10 Changes: 
  o Support for max_concur_session added.  This includes requisite changes in
    the Context and User module and their tests.
  o Significantly enhanced coverage testing -- everything is as close to 100%
    as I can make it.
  o Some fixpack changed the policy methods such that I have to provide a
    valid number even if I am disabling the policy.  The code has been
    modified to reflect this.
  o Added a TAG to the test scripts to make running my coverage tests easier.
  o Created the test file for Objectspace.
  o Documentation added fo qop, tod, warnmode, attributes and exists to POP
  o Changed all the calls in SSO::Web to use "desc" as the key for
    description.
  o Added name() method to Server
  o Removed several redundant or otherwise useless error traps
  o The output from a full coverage run has been included.  This is mostly for
    my own benefit, so I can tell if a bug is something new or something I
    never noticed.
