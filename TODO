------
It would be really cool to add attach and detach methods to POP and ACL.  They
will largely be wrappers around the ProtObject calls, but I like the sense of
completeness.
------
The create methods are not very standard yet.  They should all check at least
the object class before calling new.  They all also need to verify $self did
not return undef
-------
Should ever find method allow a filter?
